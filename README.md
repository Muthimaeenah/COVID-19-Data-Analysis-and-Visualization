# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes global COVID-19 data with a focus on selected countries: the United States, India, and Kenya. It explores case trends, deaths, and vaccinations through data visualization and analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Load and clean COVID-19 data from Our World in Data
- Analyze key metrics such as total cases, total deaths, and daily new cases
- Visualize trends using line plots and choropleth maps
- Derive insights about the pandemic's impact on different countries

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** â€“ for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** â€“ for visualizations
- **Plotly Express** â€“ for interactive maps
- **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for documentation and analysis

## ðŸš€ How to Run/View the Project

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed (`pip install notebook`).
3. Open the `COVID19_Data_Analysis.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Make sure the dataset file `owid-covid-data.csv` is in the same directory.
5. Run each cell sequentially to view the results and visualizations.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights & Reflections

- **USA** reported the highest total cases and deaths.
- **India** experienced the steepest spikes during variant waves.
- **Kenya** had relatively fewer cases but also lower vaccination rates.
- **Death rates** appeared to decline with increased vaccine rollout.
- Data completeness varies across countries, affecting interpretation.
